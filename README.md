# What's Big O ? 
    Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity. It allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input grows.
    So, we say that an algorithm is O(f(n)) if the number of small operations the computer has to do is eventually less than a constant mulitplied by f(n) ,as n increases. In this case, f(n) takes 2 seconds no matter what n is. So, we say that O(2) meaning the big O notation for this f(n) is 2.
    On the otherhand, if f(n) = n*2, then as n increases the times increases quadratically.
